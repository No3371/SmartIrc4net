A fork of [SmartIrc4Net](https://github.com/meebey/SmartIrc4net), mainly focus on refactoring IrcConnection class to use TPL instead of Threads.

A lot of files in the original repo is beyond my knowledge, so this repo is stripped down to only source files.

The license is upgraded from LGPL 2.1 to LGPL 3. (Is that ok?)
